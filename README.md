# ✈️ Airline Passenger Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline passenger data using **Power BI**.  
The objective is to transform raw airline data into **meaningful insights** through data cleaning, analysis, and interactive dashboards.

The dashboard helps understand:
- Passenger distribution
- Demographic patterns
- Monthly travel trends
- Airport and country-level traffic

---

## 🧭 Project Storyline

This project follows a structured data analytics storyline, starting from raw data and ending with actionable insights.

### 1️⃣ Understanding the Problem
Airline data is often large and unstructured, making it difficult to identify passenger trends, demographics, and travel patterns.  
The goal of this project is to answer key questions such as:
- Who is travelling?
- When do passengers travel the most?
- Which regions and airports handle the highest traffic?

---

### 2️⃣ Data Collection
The dataset used in this project contains airline passenger information including:
- Passenger demographics
- Flight status
- Airport and destination details
- Travel dates

This dataset represents real-world airline data with inconsistencies such as mixed date formats and redundant columns.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Before analysis, the data was cleaned using **Power Query** to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Key cleaning steps included:
- Removing unnecessary personal information
- Standardizing categorical values
- Fixing mixed date formats
- Creating derived columns like Age Groups and Month attributes

This step ensured the data was **analytics-ready**.

---

### 4️⃣ Data Modeling & Measures
After cleaning:
- A simple data model was used
- DAX measures were created to calculate dynamic metrics such as passenger counts
- Measures were reused across multiple visuals to ensure consistency

This allowed all visuals to respond dynamically to filters and slicers.

---

### 5️⃣ Dashboard Design & Analysis
The analysis was divided into **four logical dashboard pages**, each answering a specific business question:

- **Overview Dashboard**  
  Provides a high-level summary of passenger count, flight status, and regional distribution.

- **Demographic Analysis**  
  Focuses on age groups, gender distribution, and nationality-wise passenger trends.

- **Time-Based Analysis**  
  Examines monthly travel patterns to identify seasonality and peak travel periods.

- **Airport & Country Analysis**  
  Identifies busiest airports, major destinations, and country-level passenger traffic.

Each page builds upon the previous one, moving from **general insights to detailed analysis**.

---

### 6️⃣ Insight Generation
From the dashboards, key insights were extracted, such as:
- Young adults and adults form the majority of passengers
- Travel activity shows clear monthly seasonality
- A small number of airports handle a large share of passenger traffic
- Passenger distribution varies significantly across continents

---

### 7️⃣ Conclusion & Decision Support
The final dashboards convert raw airline data into clear visual insights that can support:
- Operational planning
- Resource allocation
- Understanding passenger behavior

This completes the analytics storyline from **data → analysis → insights → decisions**.

---
